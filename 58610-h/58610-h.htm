<p class="tb">Fort Raleigh National Historic Site directly connects the
American people with the Court of Queen Elizabeth and the
golden age of English art, literature, and adventure. The figures
who play the chief roles in the story of the exploration and attempted
settlement of the island are the epic figures of English history: Queen
Elizabeth, after whom the new land was named &ldquo;Virginia,&rdquo; is easily the
premier sovereign of England; Sir Walter Raleigh, poet, soldier, and
statesman, and the inspiration and financial mainstay of the Roanoke
Island project, is the best remembered of gallant English courtiers; Sir
Richard Grenville, of the <i>Revenge</i>, who brought the first colony to America
in 1585 and left another small group there in 1586, is the Elizabethan
hero who in 1592 taught English sailors how to dare and die in the face
of overwhelming odds; Sir Frances Drake, who rescued the first colony
from starvation, is famous as the first English circumnavigator of the
globe and as the preeminent seadog and explorer of English history.</p>
<p>As Plymouth and other early New England sites connect the United
States with the great European movement known as the Reformation,
so the scene of Raleigh&rsquo;s settlements connects the American people with
the powerful activating force known as the Renaissance. When energized
by the Renaissance movement, the human spirit knew no earthly
bounds nor recognized any limits to intellectual or physical endeavor.
Thus, Raleigh, who was born a gentleman of only moderate estate, willed
to be the favorite of a Queen, aspired to found an empire across the seas
in the teeth of Imperial Spain and undertook in prison to write the history
of the world! For the glory and enrichment of England, Sir Francis
Drake pillaged the cities and mighty galleons of Spain and dared to sail
around the globe. Sir Richard Grenville, shortly after his memorable
voyages to Roanoke Island, gave the British Navy an immortal tradition
by duelling for a day and a night with one small ship against a Spanish
fleet of 53.</p>

<p>Truly heroic was the Roanoke Island colonial venture. Here, despite
the hostility of Spain and Spanish Florida, the greatest naval and colonial
power of that day, the agents of Sir Walter Raleigh and the subjects of
Queen Elizabeth suffered, or died, in the first serious effort to begin the
conquest of the larger part of the North American continent by the
slow process of agriculture, industry, trade, and natural increase. The
hardships of the first colony under Governor Lane, 1585-86, and the
disappearance of the &ldquo;Lost Colony&rdquo; of 1587 taught the English the practical
difficulties that would be attendant upon the conquest of the continent
and enabled them to grow in colonial wisdom. Thus, the birth
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
of Virginia Dare, in the &ldquo;Citie of Raleigh in Virginia,&rdquo; August 18, 1587,
first child of English parentage to be born in the New World, was a
prophetic symbol of the future rise of a new English-speaking nation
beyond the seas.</p>
<p>Jamestown, Va., commemorates the successful settlement of English
America growing out of the dreams of Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir
Humphrey Gilbert, his elder half-brother. Fort Raleigh, because of the
tragic mystery of the &ldquo;Lost Colony,&rdquo; memorializes better than any other
site the cost of early English colonial effort. To a certain degree it also
commemorates a forgotten part of the price that England paid for English
liberty. The colonists at Fort Raleigh were, in a sense, sacrificed that
England might employ all her fighting strength against the juggernaut
of Spain in the battle against the Armada. To relieve the Roanoke colony
in 1588, in the place of Grenville&rsquo;s warships, only two small
pinnaces could be spared, and these did not reach Roanoke. For the
glorious victory over the Armada and for the gradual emergence of
British sea power after 1588, England gave her infant colony in America.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>Gilbert and Raleigh</i></span></h2>
<p>The statesmen, merchants, and ship captains of Elizabethan England
shared the adventurous and speculative spirit of the Spaniards and Portuguese
who had established empires in the West after 1492. Religious
zeal and both personal and national interests impelled Englishmen to
compete with Spain and Portugal for a share in the exploration and development
of the New World. Englishmen wondered if they could not
find a northwest passage through the American continent which would
divert the wealth of the Indies to England, or if they could not translate
the mineral and agricultural wealth of North America into English
fortunes as Spaniards had grown rich from the gold of Mexico and Peru.</p>
<p>On June 11, 1578, Sir Humphrey Gilbert obtained from Queen Elizabeth
a charter to discover and colonize &ldquo;remote heathen and barbarous
lands&rdquo; not actually possessed by any Christian prince. In 1583, he
ventured almost his entire fortune, as well as that of his wife, Anne
Aucher, in an attempt to explore the northern part of North America
and found a colony in the New World. The Queen herself displayed
interest in the enterprise by giving Raleigh a good-luck token to send
to Gilbert just before the expedition sailed. Gilbert landed at St. John&rsquo;s,
Newfoundland, which he claimed for England, but on coasting southward
he met with repeated misfortunes, turned away, and was himself
drowned on the return voyage to England. He had insisted on sailing in
one of his smaller ships. &ldquo;I will not forsake my little company going
homeward, with whom I have passed so many stormes and perils.&rdquo;
Among his last recorded words was the famous cry to his men in the
larger boat, &ldquo;We are as neere to heaven by sea as by land.&rdquo; His last will
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
and testament, dated July 8, 1582, makes clear that his ultimate purpose
had been to found an English empire beyond the seas to be colonized
by English people.</p>

</div>
<p>Gilbert&rsquo;s heroic death must have deeply moved his half-brother, Sir
Walter Raleigh. The latter had voyaged with Sir Humphrey Gilbert in
an expedition of 1578 and had fitted out a ship intended to participate
in the great voyage of 1583 to Newfoundland. In 1584, when the Gilbert
patent was to expire, Raleigh stood high in the favor of the Queen and
received from her a charter which confirmed to him the powers formerly
enjoyed by Sir Humphrey Gilbert.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Exploration of Roanoke Island, 1584</i></span></h2>
<p>On April 27, 1584, Captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe left
the west of England in two barks &ldquo;well furnished with men and victuals,&rdquo;
to explore the North American coast for Sir Walter Raleigh.
Among the company of explorers was the enigmatical Simon Ferdinando,
formerly the master of the ship <i>Falcon</i> under the captaincy of
Raleigh, but also known as the &ldquo;man&rdquo; of the Queen&rsquo;s Secretary of State,
Sir Francis Walsingham. Ferdinando had sailed to the coast of America
and back in 3 months&rsquo; time in 1579. His knowledge of navigation was
to make him a key figure in many of the Roanoke Island enterprises.</p>
<p>The party of explorers landed on July 13, 1584, on the North Carolina
coast, about 7 leagues above Roanoke Island, and took possession of
the country for Queen Elizabeth &ldquo;as rightfull Queene&rdquo; with the further
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
proviso that the land was to be for the use of Sir Walter Raleigh, according
to the Queen&rsquo;s charter. Despite the passing of more than 350 years,
Barlowe&rsquo;s description of the country is still basically true, if pardonably
exuberant. They found it &ldquo;very sandie and low toward the waters side,
but so full of grapes [scuppernongs] as the very beating and surge of
the Sea overflowed them, of which we found such plentie, as well there
as in all places else, both on the sand and on the greene soil on the hils,
as in the plaines, as well on every little shrubbe, as also climing towards
the tops of high Cedars, that I thinke in all the world the like abundance
is not to be found.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p06c.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="451" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The shore line of Roanoke Island as it looks today.</i></p>
</div>
<p>From their landing place they proceeded along the seashore toward
the &ldquo;toppes of those hilles next adjoining&rdquo; (perhaps the big Nags Head
Dunes or hills in the Nags Head woods), from the summit of which
they beheld the sea on both sides and came to realize that they were on
a barrier island. After admiring the scene, they discharged an arquebus
shot, whereupon &ldquo;a flocke of Cranes (the most part white) arose ...
with such a cry redoubled by many ecchoes, as if an armie of men had
showted all together.&rdquo; On the fourth day they were visited by Granganimeo,
brother of Wingina, chief of the Roanoke Island Indians.
After a short period of trading, Barlowe and seven others went by boat
to Roanoke Island at the north end of which they found a palisaded
Indian village. Here they were entertained with primitive but hospitable
Indian ceremony. The Indians appeared &ldquo;gentle, loving, and faithfull.&rdquo;
The explorers described Roanoke Island as &ldquo;a most pleasant and fertile
ground, replenished with goodly Cedars, and divers other sweete woods,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
full of Corrants [grapes], flaxe, and many other notable commodities.&rdquo;
Game and fish were to be had in abundance.</p>
<p>The picture that Amadas and Barlowe took back to Sir Walter Raleigh
was a rosy one, for they had seen Roanoke Island in midsummer. The
Indians were generous, because at this season of the year they had plenty
of everything in contrast to the scarcity of their winter fare; and the
white man was new to them, though they had heard of others wrecked
on the coast years before. Two Indians, Wanchese and Manteo, were
brought back to England by Amadas and Barlowe that Raleigh might
learn, first hand, the character of the coastal Indians. Queen Elizabeth
appears to have been pleased by the western exploit, for she called the
new possession Virginia, perhaps at the suggestion of Raleigh, chief
lord of the new territory, whose poetic gift and courtly tact would
prompt him thus to memorialize the virgin queen.</p>

<p>The next Spring, Raleigh sent a colony of 108 persons to Roanoke

Grenville, sailed from Plymouth, England, on April 9, 1585, in seven
ships, the largest of which was of 140 tons&rsquo; burthen. Included in the

then on his first great voyage but destined to be the third circumnavigator

among them Richard Gilbert, a Courtenay, a Prideaux, Ralph Lane, and
Anthony Rowse, a friend of Drake&rsquo;s. There were an artist, or illustrator,
John White; a scientist, named Thomas Hariot; and, among the humbler
folk, an Irishman, Darby Glande or Glaven. The two Indians,
Wanchese and Manteo, returned to America on this voyage.</p>

<h3 id="c4"><span class="sc">THE VOYAGE.</span></h3>
<p>The route chosen lay via the Canaries and the Spanish
West Indies. They anchored at &ldquo;Moskito Bay&rdquo; in the Island of &ldquo;St.
Johns&rdquo; (Puerto Rico), May 12, where they constructed a fort, set up a
forge to make nails, and built a pinnace to replace one lost in a storm.
They left Puerto Rico toward the end of May after burning the fort and
surrounding woods and after seizing two Spanish frigates. Just before
departing, Ralph Lane raided &ldquo;Roxo bay&rdquo; in one of the captured frigates,
built a fort, and seized a supply of salt.</p>

</div>
<p>These bellicose activities of the English in Puerto Rico illustrate the
fact that England and Spain were virtually at war at that time. Indeed,
the war was to become an actuality within 3 years. In the meantime, the
English were engaged in what would be called today a &ldquo;cold war&rdquo;&mdash;pin-pricking
the Spaniard in the West Indies and about to settle on the
American mainland at a spot sufficiently close to Spanish Florida to
constitute both an economic and a military threat to Spain. Growth of
the English colony would circumscribe Spain&rsquo;s own colonial effort; at
the same time, the location chosen for the English colony was close
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
enough to serve as a base of operations against Spanish new world shipping.
That both possibilities were uppermost in the minds of Raleigh
and Grenville and their supporters at court is obvious. One of the weaknesses
of their colonial program was their persistent thought the
privateering operations against Spanish shipping should, or could, be
made to pay the cost of English colonial effort.</p>

</div>
<p>The first part of June found the English banqueting the uneasy Spanish
Governor at Isabella on the Island of Hispaniola (Haiti). To impress
the Governor, Grenville treated him to a sumptuous meal served &ldquo;all in
plate&rdquo; to the &ldquo;sound of trumpets and consort of musicke.&rdquo; The Governor
entertained in turn and, subsequently, the English traded with the
Spaniards for commodities that would be needed in their colonial
settlement: &ldquo;horses, mares, kine, buls, goates, swine, sheepe, bull-hides,
sugar, ginger,&rdquo; etc. From the Spanish accounts of Grenville&rsquo;s actions in
Puerto Rico and Haiti are gained some interesting personal glimpses.
The officers and persons of distinction in the expedition were served
upon silver plate which was chased and gilt. Wanchese and Manteo had
learned to speak English, and the illustrator, John White, was already
engaged in drawing pictures of strange plants and objects.</p>

<h3 id="c5"><span class="sc">THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COLONY.</span></h3>
<p>An island south of Cape
Hatteras, now known as Ocracoke, was reached on June 26. The
remainder of the month and most of July were spent in exploring the
coastal islands and the adjacent mainland. During one of these expeditions,
Grenville sought to strike terror into the hearts of the Indians by
burning the Indian village of Aquascogok in retaliation for the theft of
a silver cup stolen by one of the Indians. Not until July 27 did Grenville
anchor at Hatoraske, off the barrier island, a short distance southeast
of Roanoke Island. Here at a break in the barrier reef, almost due east
of the southern tip of Roanoke Island, Simon Ferdinando discovered a
port, named Port Ferdinando in his honor and considered the best port
along that stretch of coast.</p>
<p>A colony was established on the &ldquo;North end&rdquo; of Roanoke Island, and
Ralph Lane was made Governor. From Port Ferdinando, and later from
Roanoke Island, letters were written by Lane to Secretary Walsingham
informing him of the successful founding of the colony. Still another
letter was written to Sir Philip Sidney, son-in-law of Walsingham, who
was interested in western discovery. A letter to Richard Hakluyt, geographer
and historian, written by Lane from the settlement on Roanoke
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Island indicated that the Governor of Virginia was impressed by the
&ldquo;huge and unknowen greatnesse&rdquo; of the American continent. He added
that if Virginia only had horses and cows in some reasonable proportion
and were inhabited by Englishmen, no realm in Christendom would be
comparable to it. The Indians, he said naively, were &ldquo;courteous, and
very desirous to have clothes,&rdquo; but valued red copper above everything
else. Wingina, chief of the Roanoke Island Indians, had received the
white men hospitably and had cooperated with them in the initial
phases of the founding of the settlement. This is clear from Grenville&rsquo;s
account as well as Lane&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Grenville lingered a short while after the founding of the settlement,
then returned to England for supplies. On the way home he captured a
richly laden Spanish ship, which must have repaid him handsomely for
his western trip. On his arrival in England, he too reported to Walsingham,
thus acknowledging the interest of the Queen and emphasizing
the seminational character of the Virginian enterprise.</p>
<p>Lane built a fort called &ldquo;The new Fort in Virginia,&rdquo; where the present
Fort Raleigh National Historic Site is situated and where the remains
of a fort were still visible as late as 1896. The fort was located near the
shore on the east side of Roanoke Island between the &ldquo;North Point&rdquo;
of the north end of the Island and a &ldquo;creek.&rdquo; The mouth of the so-called
creek was big enough to serve as the anchorage for small boats (Shallow
Bag Bay, known as late as 1716 as &ldquo;Town Creek&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Lane&rsquo;s fort on Roanoke Island resembled in some noteworthy respects
the fort which he had built on St. Johns Island, Puerto Rico, in May
1585, when he seized the salt supply. Both forts seem to have been
roughly shaped like a star built on a square with the bastions constructed
on the sides of the square instead of at the corners, as was
common in later fortifications. Copies of the plans of these forts may be
seen in the Fort Raleigh museum.</p>
<p>The dwelling houses of the early colonists were near the fort, which
was too small to enclose them. They were described by the colonists
themselves as &ldquo;decent dwelling houses&rdquo; or &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; and must have
been at least a story and a half or two stories high, because we have a
reference to the &ldquo;neather roomes of them.&rdquo; The roofs were thatched, as
we learn from Ralph Lane&rsquo;s statement that the Indians by night &ldquo;would
have beset my house, and put fire in the reedes that the same was covered
with.&rdquo; The chimneys and the foundations may have been of brick,
because Darby Glande later testified that &ldquo;as soon as they had disembarked
<a id="Roanoke">Roanoke</a> they began to make brick and fabric for a fort and
houses.&rdquo; Pieces of brick were reported found at the fort site as late as
1860, and recent archeological work at the fort turned up a few brickbats,
possibly of the Elizabethan period.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Thomas Hariot remarked that though stone was not found on the
island, there was good clay for making bricks, and lime could be made
from nearby deposits of oyster shells in the same manner that lime was
made &ldquo;in the Isles of Tenet and Shepy, and also in divers other places of
England.&rdquo; However, as no evidence of the extensive use of brick has yet
been found, it is perhaps safe to assume that the chief building material
was rough boards. It has already been noted that they had a forge which
they could set up to make nails. Richard Hakluyt, in his <i>Discourse of
Western Planting</i>, written at the request of Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584,
about 1 year before the colony sailed, had recommended as &ldquo;things to
be prepared for the voyadge&rdquo; that any colonial expedition should include
&ldquo;men experte in the arte of fortification,&rdquo; &ldquo;makers of spades and
shovells,&rdquo; &ldquo;shipwrights,&rdquo; &ldquo;millwrights, to make milles for spedy and
cheape sawing of timber and boardes for trade, and first traficque of
suertie,&rdquo; &ldquo;millwrights, for corne milles,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sawyers for common use,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Carpinters, for buildinges,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brick makers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tile makers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lyme
makers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bricklayers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tilers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thatchers with reedes, rushes,
broome, or strawe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rough Masons,&rdquo; &ldquo;Carpinters,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lathmakers.&rdquo;
The presumption therefore is that typical English thatched cottages and
houses, such as were found in rural Elizabethan England, were built at
Roanoke. (The log cabin appears to have been introduced into America
about 50 years later by the Swedes and Finns on the Delaware.) The
Roanoke cottages were presumably well built. The skilled labor of the
expedition had been able to construct a seaworthy pinnace at Puerto
Rico in less than a month&rsquo;s time.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><span class="sc">LIFE IN THE COLONY.</span></h3>
<p>At first, relations with the Indians continued
friendly, though the Englishmen had their detractors in the Council of
the Indian Chief. The aborigines planted crops and made fish traps for
the Englishmen. With rare foresight, the colonists also induced Chief
Wingina (who had changed his name to Pemisapan) to put into simultaneous
cultivation his lands both on Roanoke Island and on the mainland
at Dasamonquepeuc in order that the Indians might have no
excuse for not being able to supply the colony if need arose. The coast
was explored by the English as far south as Secotan (about 80 miles)
and as far north as the Chesapeake (about 130 miles). Thomas Hariot
collected data on plants, animals, and minerals for his <i>New Found Land
of Virginia</i>. John White made the inimitable water-color drawings of
the Indians, the animal and plant life of Roanoke Island, and the coast,
which have been engraved many times. The much rarer facsimile reproductions
of these drawings in color may be seen in the Fort Raleigh
museum. These paintings are the first artistic productions of Englishmen
in America. The colonists also learned to smoke tobacco, using for this
purpose Indian pipes or other pipes of their own modeled on the Indian
pipes.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>How closely the personnel of the first colony conformed to the standard
suggested by Hakluyt in 1584 is not known; but historical documents
indicate that there were men expert in fortification and that there
were brickmakers, carpenters, and thatchers. Also the names of all
of the colonists are known, if not their trades. Some were gentlemen,
cousins of Raleigh and Grenville, as the names indicate. Hariot says
that some were city dwellers &ldquo;of a nice bringing up&rdquo; who soon became
miserable without their soft beds and dainty food. Others were excellent
soldiers, as Lane testified of Captain Stafford; and there were the humbler
folk, of whom Darby Glande was perhaps representative, though
he was Irish and appears to have been forced to accompany the expedition.
On the whole, they gave the appearance more of a military
expedition than a colony. They were dependent upon the Indians and
upon England for both food and supplies. Many of their basic commodities,
such as salt, horses, and cattle, had been obtained in the first
instance by trade, or by force, from the Spaniards in the West Indies.
There appear to have been no women among them to give permanence
to the settlement.</p>
<p>Grenville&rsquo;s deplorable action in burning the village of Aquascogok
was indicative of the fact that the high-spirited Englishmen of that day
could not live on even terms with the natives. In the lean period between
the planting of crops in the spring and the expected summer
harvest, English relations with the Indians grew strained and finally
reached the point at which no further supplies could be had from them.
Once the colonists and Indians were at odds, the fish traps began to be
robbed or destroyed. Food became scarce, and Lane was forced to send
groups of settlers to the barrier islands along the coast to live on oysters
and other shell fish and to look for passing ships. Master Prideaux and
10 men were sent to Hatoraske Island for this purpose, while Captain
Stafford and 20 men went to Croatoan Island, south of Cape Hatteras.
(Croatoan Island is a sixteenth-century name, not to be confused with
modern Croatan Sound area.) Sixteen or twenty others were sent at
intervals to the mainland to live on oysters and native foods.</p>
<p>By June 1, 1586, the colonists were at open war with the Indians, and
many of the latter were slain in the struggles that ensued both on Roanoke
Island and on the mainland at Dasamonquepeuc. Pemisapan was
among those who were killed in the fighting.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><span class="sc">ABANDONMENT OF THE COLONY.</span></h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Grenville was delayed
in leaving England for the supply of the Roanoke colony. This placed
the colonists in a desperate predicament. Such was the state of affairs at
Roanoke Island when, on June 9, 1586, Captain Stafford brought news
of the fact that Sir Francis Drake was off the coast with a mighty fleet
of 23 ships. Richly laden with booty from his attack on the Spanish
West Indies and Florida, Drake&rsquo;s fleet anchored next day partly in the
port near Roanoke Island (probably Port Ferdinando) and partly in a
&ldquo;wilde roade&rdquo; at sea 2 miles from the shore. Second in command to
Drake on this expedition was Capt. Christopher Carleill, Secretary
Walsingham&rsquo;s stepson and son-in-law, who had been interested in
American exploration since 1574. Lane and some of his company went
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
on board Drake&rsquo;s flagship, and Drake made them a generous offer. He
would give them a ship, one or two pinnaces, a number of smaller boats,
and sufficient ship masters, sailors, and supplies to afford another month&rsquo;s
stay at Roanoke and a return voyage to England, or he would give them
all immediate return passage to England with his fleet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="750" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Christopher Carleill.</i></p>
</div>
<p>To Lane&rsquo;s credit
it must be said that he was loath to give up the Roanoke Island project.
He accepted the first offer, and the ship was turned over to him; but
before the supplies could be made ready, a storm arose and the ship was
blown out to sea and did not return. The fleet suffered other losses in
this storm, but Drake remained open handed. He offered Lane supplies
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
as before and another ship, but since this vessel was much too large
to be kept in Lane&rsquo;s only harbor, its acceptance, and dependence on it,
involved a great risk.</p>

<img src="images/p12a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="788" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Sir Francis Drake.</i> From the painting in Trinity House, London.</p>
</div>
<p>This fact, the troubled state of Europe and America, making war with
Spain now practically inevitable, and the unaccountable delay in the
arrival of Grenville&rsquo;s supply fleet caused Lane to ask for passage to
England. When Drake sailed, on June 18, he carried the colonists home
with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h3 id="c8"><span class="sc">GRENVILLE&rsquo;S FIFTEEN MEN.</span></h3>
<p>Shortly after Drake and the colonists had
sailed, a supply ship sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh arrived at Hatoraske
and after searching in vain for the colonists returned to England. About
a fortnight after Raleigh&rsquo;s ship had left, Grenville arrived with three
ships and likewise searched in vain for the colonists. Grenville found
the places of colonial settlement desolate, but being &ldquo;unwilling to loose
the possession of the country which Englishmen had so long held,&rdquo; he
left 15 men on Roanoke Island, fully provisioned for 2 years, to hold the
country for the Queen while he returned to England.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>The Lost Colony of 1587</i></span></h2>
<p>In the year 1587, Sir Walter Raleigh organized another colonial expedition
consisting of 150 persons. Its truer colonizing character was
evidenced by the significant facts that, unlike the expedition of 1585,
this one included women and children, and the men were called
&ldquo;planters.&rdquo; Its government was also less military, since the direction of
the enterprise in Virginia was to be in the hands of a syndicate of sub-patentees&mdash;a
governor and 12 assistants whom Raleigh incorporated as
the &ldquo;Governor and Assistants of the Citie of Ralegh in Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new arrangement indicated that colonization was becoming less
of a one-man venture and more of a corporate or business enterprise,
anticipating in a certain degree the later English companies that were to
found successful colonies in Virginia and New England. Exactly what
inducements Raleigh offered to the planters are not known. His terms
were probably liberal, however, because Hariot, writing in February
1587, paid tribute to Raleigh&rsquo;s generosity, saying that the least that he
had granted had been 500 acres of land to each man willing to go to
America. Those contributing money or supplies, as well as their person,
probably stood to receive more. From the list of names that has come
down to us, it would appear that at least 10 of the planters took their
wives with them. Ambrose Viccars and Arnold Archard brought not
only their wives but one child each, Ambrose Viccars and Thomas
Archard. Altogether there were at least 17 women and 9 children in the
group that arrived safely in Virginia.</p>
<p>In still another respect, this second colonial expedition seemed to
anticipate the later Jamestown settlement. Raleigh had directed, in writing,
that the fort and colony be established in the Chesapeake Bay area
where a better port could be had and where conditions for settlement
were considered to be more favorable.</p>

<p>The fleet, consisting of three ships, sailed from Plymouth for Virginia
on May 8. Continuity with the previous expeditions was afforded in the
persons of the Governor, John White, who was to make in all five trips
to Virginia, Simon Ferdinando, Captain Stafford, Darby Glande, the
Irishman, and perhaps others. The route, as in 1585, lay via &ldquo;Moskito
Bay&rdquo; in Puerto Rico. Here Darby Glande was left behind, or escaped,
and lived to testify regarding the first Roanoke Island colony before the
Spanish authorities at St. Augustine some years later. The expedition
sailed along the coast of Haiti, even passing by &ldquo;Isabella&rdquo; where Grenville
had traded with the Spaniards for cattle and other necessities in
1585, but this time there was no trading, possibly because of the precarious
relations between England and Spain, now on the eve of open
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
war. Whatever the reason for this failure to take in supplies in Haiti, it
constituted a certain handicap for the colony of 1587.</p>
<h3 id="c10"><span class="sc">THE SECOND COLONY ESTABLISHED AT ROANOKE.</span></h3>
<p>The two leading
ships of the expedition reached Hatoraske on July 22, 1587, and the
third ship on July 25. Meanwhile, on the 22d, Governor White and a
small group of planters had gone to Roanoke Island with the intention
of conferring with the 15 men left there by Grenville the preceding year.
On reaching the place where the men had been left, they found only
the bones of one of them who had been killed by the Indians. There was
no sign of the others.</p>
<p>The next day Governor White and his party &ldquo;walked to the North
end of the island, where Master Ralfe Lane had his forte, with sundry
necessary and decent dwelling houses made by his men about it the yeere
before.&rdquo; Here it was hoped some sign of Grenville&rsquo;s men would be discovered.
They found the fort razed &ldquo;but all the houses standing unhurt,
saving that the neather rooms of them, and also of the forte, were overgrown
with Melons of divers sortes, and Deere within them, feeding on
those Melons.&rdquo; All hope of finding Grenville&rsquo;s men then vanished.</p>
<p>For reasons which are obscure, but perhaps because the season was
late, it was decided to settle again at Roanoke Island rather than go on
to the Chesapeake Bay country. Those houses found Standing were repaired
and &ldquo;newe cottages&rdquo; were built. The Indians proved to be more
hostile than formerly, and George Howe, one of the assistants, was
killed by the Indians soon after the landing. Through the intercession
of the Indian Manteo, who had relatives on the barrier island of Croatoan,
friendly relations with the Croatoan Indians were reestablished,
but the others remained aloof. The remnants of the Roanoke Island
Indians dwelling at Dasamonquepeuc were accused by the Croatoan
Indians of killing Grenville&rsquo;s men as well as George Howe. Hence, on
August 8, Governor White, with Captain Stafford and 24 men, suddenly
attacked the town of Dasamonquepeuc with fire and sword. It was a
blunder. The Roanoke Indians had already fled. In their place were the
friendly Croatoan Indians who had heard of the flight of the other Indians
and had come over to take whatever corn and fruit might have
been left behind. Thanks to Manteo, the Croatoan Indians forgave the
Englishmen, or pretended to do so.</p>
<p>On August 13, complying with Raleigh&rsquo;s instructions, Manteo was
christened and declared Lord of Roanoke and Dasamonquepeuc as a
reward for his many services. Five days later, Governor White&rsquo;s daughter,
Eleanor, wife of Ananias Dare, gave birth to a daughter, who was
named Virginia because she was the first child of English parentage to
be born in the New World. Another child was born to Dyonis and
Margery Harvie shortly afterwards. On the 27th, Governor White, at
the earnest entreaty of the &ldquo;planters in Virginia,&rdquo; sailed homeward with
the fleet to obtain supplies for the colony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3 id="c11"><span class="sc">GOVERNOR WHITE&rsquo;S RETURN TO ENGLAND.</span></h3>
<p>With Governor White&rsquo;s
departure on the 27th, the history of events in the colony becomes a
tragic mystery which one can only seek to explain. There had been talk
of moving the colony 50 miles inland, and White had arranged for appropriate
indications of their whereabouts if they removed from Roanoke
Island before his return. However, White could not return as soon as
expected because of the outbreak of war with Spain. The year 1588 was
the Armada year. Sir Richard Grenville, who was preparing a new fleet
to go to Virginia, was ordered to make his ships available to the English
Navy for service against the Armada. Both Raleigh and Grenville were
assigned tasks connected with the national defense and could give little
thought to Virginian enterprises. At length, the Queen&rsquo;s Privy Council
gave Grenville permission to use on the intended Virginian voyage two
small ships not required for service against Spain. White sailed with
these on April 28, but they were small, poorly equipped, and poorly
provisioned. Partly because of these circumstances and perhaps partly
because of their own folly in running after Spanish treasure ships, they
were unable to reach Virginia in the war-torn sea. Thus, while Grenville&rsquo;s
large warships contributed to the defeat of the Armada, the
Roanoke Island colony was doomed for the lack of them.</p>
<p>Although the Armada was defeated in the summer of 1588, the Anglo-Spanish
battle of the Atlantic continued for several years. It was the
intention of Spain to carry on the war not only against England by
means of the Armada but also to seek out the English colony in the
New World and destroy it at about the same time. In the latter part of
June 1588, the Spanish Governor at St. Augustine sent a packet boat
northward to locate the English colony preparatory to an early attack on
it. After reconnoitering Chesapeake Bay, the packet boat, with the pilot
Vincente Gonzalez in command and with Juan Men&eacute;ndez Marqu&eacute;s
nephew of the Governor on board, came somewhat by chance to Port
Ferdinando. Here they found evidence of a harbor and of English occupation.
They departed hurriedly to St. Augustine to report their discovery.
They clearly thought the harbor still in use at the time of their
visit; but the projected attack, at first postponed and later thought to be
unnecessary because of the weakness of the fort and settlement, seems
never to have been made. At least that is the conclusion to be drawn
from available Spanish documents.</p>
<p>On March 7, 1589, Raleigh deeded his interest in the Virginian enterprise,
except a fifth part of all gold and silver ore, to a group of London
merchants and adventurers and to Governor White and nine other gentlemen,
&ldquo;Late of London.&rdquo; At least seven of them were planters whom
White had left in Virginia, such as Ananias Dare, his son-in-law and
father of Virginia Dare. Others included in the group were Richard
Hakluyt and Thomas Smythe, later known as Sir Thomas Smythe.</p>

</div>
<p>The months slipped by, but Governor White and the London merchants
seemed to have been unable to get a fleet organized for the relief
and strengthening of the colony. In March 1590, Raleigh endeavored
to assist White, through influence at court, when the latter learned that
Master John Wattes, of London, was being hampered by a governmental
staying order in his effort to clear a fleet of privateers for the West
Indies. The scheme appears to have been that Raleigh, acting as middleman,
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
would gain clearance for the ships and, in return, colonists and
their furniture would be transported to Virginia. The plan went awry.
Governor White sailed on March 20, 1590, for America, but without
the accompanying planters and supplies. Indeed, his status was not
much better than that of a passenger on one of Wattes&rsquo; ships, who had
limited court influence at home.</p>
<p>After operating for months in the West Indies, the Wattes expedition
anchored on the night of August 12 at the northeast end of the island
of Croatoan. If White had only known then the clue to the colonists&rsquo;
whereabouts that he was to learn 6 days later, he would have asked for
a search of that island! But he had no way of knowing the promise that
&ldquo;Croatoan&rdquo; held. After taking soundings, the fleet weighed anchor on
August 13 and arrived at Hatoraske toward the evening of the 15th.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><span class="sc">ATTEMPTS TO FIND THE LOST COLONY.</span></h3>
<p>As the ships anchored at Hatoraske,
smoke was seen rising on Roanoke Island, giving hope that the
colonists were still alive. On the morning of the 16th, Governor White,
Captain Cooke, Captain Spicer, and a small company set forth in two
boats for Roanoke Island. En route they saw another column of smoke
rising southwest of &ldquo;Kindrikers mountes.&rdquo; There are no mountains on
this coast, except the great sand dunes. Perhaps the smoke was coming
from the general area occupied today by the Nags Head dunes. They
decided to investigate this latter smoke column first. It was a wearisome
task that consumed the whole day and led to nothing, since no human
beings were at the scene of the woods fire.</p>
<p>The next day, August 17, they prepared to go to Roanoke Island.
Captain Spicer and six other men were drowned in the treacherous inlet
when their boat capsized. Despite this unfortunate occurrence, White
was able to proceed with the search. They put off again in two boats,
but before they could reach the place of settlement it was so dark that
they overshot their mark by a quarter of a mile. On the north end of the
island they saw a light and rowed toward it. Anchoring opposite it in
the darkness, they blew a trumpet and sang familiar English tunes and
songs, but received no answer. In the morning they landed on the north
end of the island and found only the grass and sundry rotten trees burning.
From this point they went through the woods to that part of the
island directly opposite Dasamonquepeuc on the mainland, west of the
north end of Roanoke Island, and from there they returned by the water&rsquo;s
edge round about the north point of the island until they came to the
place where the colony had been left by Governor White. From the
description just given of White&rsquo;s itinerary, this place must have been
near the shore on the north end of the island on the east side, i. e., at or
near the present Fort Raleigh National Historic Site. In the course of
the long walk along the shore, nothing of interest was seen except
footprints which two or three natives had made in the sand during the
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>As they climbed the sandy bank toward the settlement area, they
found CRO carved in Roman letters on a tree at the brow of the hill.
Going from there to the site of the dwelling houses, they found all of
the houses taken down and the area strongly enclosed with a palisade of
tree trunks, with curtains and flankers &ldquo;very Fort-like.&rdquo; One of the chief
trees, or posts, had the bark peeled off, and carved on it in capital letters
was the word CROATOAN, but without the maltese cross or sign of
distress that White had asked the settlers to use in such messages in the
event of enforced departure from Roanoke Island. On entering the
palisade, they found iron and other heavy objects thrown about and
almost overgrown with grass, signifying that the place had been
abandoned for some time.</p>
<p>From the fort and settlement area, White proceeded again along the
shore southward to the &ldquo;point of the creek&rdquo; (i. e., the point of Shallow
Bag Bay or, as it was called in 1716, &ldquo;Town Creek&rdquo;), which had been
fortified with &ldquo;Falkons and small Ordinance&rdquo; and where the small boats
of the colony were habitually kept, but could find no sign of any of
these things. Then, on returning to the fort and settlement area, White
searched for certain chests and personal effects which he had secretly
buried in 1587. The Indians had discovered the hiding place, had rifled
the chests, torn the covers off the books, and left the pictures and
maps to be spoiled by rain. Considering that Gov. John White was
probably John White the artist and illustrator of the expedition of
1585-86, one can imagine his feelings on seeing his maps and pictures
irretrievably ruined. However, according to his own words he was
cheered at the thought that, as indicated by the word CROATOAN on
the palisade post, &ldquo;a certaine token,&rdquo; his daughter, granddaughter
Virginia Dare, and the colonists would be found at Croatoan Island,
where Manteo was born and where the Indians had been friendly to the
English.</p>
<p>As stormy weather was brewing, White and his little group returned
in haste to the harbor where their ships were at anchor. Next day they
agreed to go to Croatoan Island to look for the colonists but the weather
would not permit. They planned to go to the West Indies instead,
where they would have taken on fresh water and ultimately have returned
to Croatoan. However, the elements willed otherwise and they
were blown toward the Azores. From Flores in this group, they made
their way to England.</p>
<p>Governor White could not finance another expedition to America
himself, and Raleigh, although enjoying a large income at times, spent
lavishly. Some of the money and energy that might have gone into the
Virginian enterprise, Raleigh expended, during 1587-1602, in colonizing
estates which he had received in Ireland. The Virginian enterprise
would have required a prince&rsquo;s purse, but Raleigh was not a prince.
Walsingham died in 1590, a blow to Raleigh. In July 1592, Raleigh was
disgraced and imprisoned for marrying Elizabeth Throckmorton without
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the Queen&rsquo;s knowledge or consent. White, therefore, accepted the
facts with resignation. His last recorded words, dated February 4, 1593,
are: &ldquo;And wanting my wishes, I leave off from prosecuting that whereunto
I would to God my wealth were answerable to my will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As late as 1602, Raleigh was still seeking in vain for his lost colony.
In that year he sent out an expedition under Samuel Mace, who reached
land some &ldquo;40 leagues to the so-westward of Hatarask,&rdquo; presumably at
or near Croatoan Island. Here they engaged in trading with the Indians
along the coast. They probably did not look as diligently as they should
have for the lost colonists, because they alleged that the weather made
their intended search unsafe. On August 21, 1602, in a letter to Sir
Robert Cecil, Raleigh expressed his undying faith in the overseas English
Empire which he had attempted to establish, saying, &ldquo;... I shall
yet live to see it an English Nation.&rdquo; The memory of the Lost Roanoke
Colony by that time had become an imperishable English tradition.
After the establishment of the Jamestown settlement in Virginia in
1607, the Virginia colonists evidenced an almost constant interest in
trying to learn from the Indians the whereabouts of the Roanoke
settlers. However, the hearsay data they collected were never sufficiently
concrete to be of any real assistance in locating Raleigh&rsquo;s men, and the
answer remains a mystery to this day.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>Connecting Links with Jamestown and New England</i></span></h2>
<p>Following his marriage to Elizabeth Throckmorton, which displeased
the Queen, Raleigh remained out of favor until after the capture of
Cadiz, in 1596, in which he had participated. Upon the accession of
King James I, in 1603, he again lost favor at Court and on July 16, 1603,
was imprisoned in the Tower of London on the charge of having conspired
to place Arabella Stuart on the throne instead of James. At the
trial in November, Raleigh, along with Lords Cobham and Grey, was
convicted and condemned to death. The lives of all three were dramatically
spared at the last minute, but the conviction and sentence of
death against Raleigh were allowed to stand and he remained in prison
in the Tower until 1616.</p>
<p>One consequence of the conviction of Raleigh was the loss of any
rights that he might still have had under the patent of 1584 giving him
the sole right to colonize the vast territory called Virginia. The patent
had obligated him to settle Virginia within 6 years but so long as the
mystery of the Lost Colonists remained unsolved, Raleigh could allege
that his colonists might be living somewhere in Virginia and that in
consequence his rights under the Charter of Queen Elizabeth were still
in force. These claims he asserted as late as 1603. In fact, the abolition of
Raleigh&rsquo;s claims appears to have been one of the outstanding consequences
of the Cobham plot trails. Because his patent was now clearly
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
lost and because of his imprisonment, Raleigh was unable to participate
in the movement that culminated in the settlement of Virginia in 1607.
Yet this movement, and the movement to settle New England, had close
ties with him. Among the leading spirits behind the later successful
Virginian enterprise were Richard Hakluyt and Sir Thomas Smythe,
two of those to whom Raleigh had deeded his interest in the Lost
Colony undertaking on March 7, 1589. Likewise, among the early leaders
of the North Virginia, or Plymouth, group were Raleigh Gilbert and
Sir John Gilbert, sons of Raleigh&rsquo;s half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert.
Raleigh Gilbert participated in the effort to plant a settlement on the
Kennebec River in Maine in 1607 and was a member of the Plymouth
Company as late as 1620.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>Later Historical Information on Fort Raleigh</i></span></h2>
<p>According to a letter, dated May 8, 1654, from Francis Yeardley, of
Virginia, to John Farrar, a young trader and three companions went to
Roanoke Island in September 1653. An Indian Chieftain &ldquo;received them
civilly and showed them the ruins of Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s fort.&rdquo; They
brought back a sure token of their having been there, which they gave
to Yeardley.</p>
<p>John Lawson wrote that the ruins of the fort could be seen in 1709
and that old English coins, a brass gun, a powder horn and a small
quarter-deck gun made of iron staves and hooped with iron had been
found on the site.</p>
<p>An act of 1723 regarding a proposed town on Roanoke Island speaks
of &ldquo;300 Acres of Land lying on the No. E&rsquo;t side of the said Island, commonly
called Roanoke old plantation,&rdquo; thus suggesting that at that date
the northeastern part of the island was regarded as the scene of Raleigh&rsquo;s
settlements.</p>
<p>The earliest known map to show Fort Raleigh is the Collet map of
1770, which indicates a fort on the northeast side of the island near the
shore line at what appears to be the present Fort Raleigh site. It is
marked simply &ldquo;Fort,&rdquo; without name. A later copyist calls it &ldquo;Pain Fort,&rdquo;
probably because he confused the notation of Paine&rsquo;s residence on the
Collet map (in different type from &ldquo;Fort&rdquo;) as part of the fort name.
Benson J. Lossing, the historian, wrote in 1850 that &ldquo;slight traces of
Lane&rsquo;s fort&rdquo; could then be seen &ldquo;near the north end&rdquo; of Roanoke Island.
Edward C. Bruce reported in <i>Harper&rsquo;s New Monthly Magazine</i>, May 1860,
that the trench of the fort was clearly traceable as a square of about 40
yards each way, with one corner thrown out in the form of a small bastion.
He also mentions fragments of stone and brick. Partial archeological
excavation of the fort was undertaken by Talcott Williams in 1895.
Additional archeological excavations by the National Park Service were
undertaken in 1947, 1948, and 1950.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>Recent History of Fort Raleigh</i></span></h2>
<p>On April 30, 1894, the Roanoke Colony Memorial Association purchased
the fort and 10 acres of surrounding land for memorial purposes.
In 1896, the memorial area was extended to 16.45 acres, and the Virginia
Dare monument was erected. In order to promote a more active program
of interpretation at Fort Raleigh, the Roanoke Island Historical Association
was organized in 1932. With Federal aid a series of buildings,
constituting a symbolical restoration and an open-air theater, were
constructed. In 1935, the area became a State historical park under the
administration of the North Carolina Historical Commission. Two
years later, the production of Paul Green&rsquo;s <i>Lost Colony</i> pageant-drama
attracted Nation-wide attention to Fort Raleigh. The immediate success
of the play caused it to be repeated each season, and the performance is
now recognized as America&rsquo;s outstanding folk play.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><i>Guide to the Area</i></span></h2>
<h3><span class="sc">THE BOUNDARY STOCKADE.</span></h3>
<p>You enter Fort Raleigh National Historic
Site between two small block houses built of logs, constituting a part of
the boundary stockade. This stockade is of modern construction, and
originally it marked the boundary of the 16.45 acre tract of the Roanoke
Island Historical Association which was administered as a North Carolina
State historical park between 1935-41. In 1951, one side of the
stockade was relocated and the area of the national historic site was increased
to 18.50 acres. Although quite modern and located along a
modern boundary, it recalls that Governor White on returning to the
site of the colony in 1590 found it fortified by a palisade of tree trunks
(location still unknown) and hence creates a sense of stepping upon
hallowed ground upon entering the gateway. The feeling is certainly
justified, because the 18.50 acres lie on the entrance side of the fort
and even if the fort had held only Grenville&rsquo;s 15 men they would have
trod this ground many times. As there were 108 persons in the first
colony under Lane, who built the fort, and 150 in the &ldquo;Lost Colony,&rdquo;
the use of the area near the entrance to this fort must have been
considerable.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">SYMBOLIC LOG HOUSES.</span></h3>
<p>Inside the boundary stockade you will pass
a number of log houses, all of modern construction, serving various
utilitarian purposes. As the true location and physical appearances of the
settlers&rsquo; houses of 1585-87 are unknown, the National Park Service
plans to remove these log structures when their present uses have been
served.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h3><span class="sc">RESTORED FORT.</span></h3>
<p>The historic object of chief interest at Fort Raleigh
is the fort built by Ralph Lane during 1585-86 and called by him &ldquo;the
new Fort in Virginia.&rdquo; As the settlers of the Lost Colony of 1587 are
known to have rebuilt for their own use the houses which Lane&rsquo;s men
constructed about the fort, it may be safely assumed that this same fort
served them also for a time, at least until they found it necessary to erect
the great stockade made of tree trunks that Governor White found
enclosing their settlement area in 1590.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="597" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Aerial view of the restored fort.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In an earlier part of this book, the history of the fort between 1586
and 1896 has been traced. During 1935-46, National Park Service historians
made intensive historical studies of all available documentary
and map data relating to the fort. They concluded that the fort surveyed
for the Roanoke Colony Historical Association, in 1896, was Lane&rsquo;s fort
and surmised that its shape was similar to that of the fort built by Lane
in Puerto Rico in 1585. They could only surmise this because, unlike
Lane&rsquo;s fort in Puerto Rico which is shown in a drawing by John White
now in the British Museum, no picture or plan of Lane&rsquo;s fort on Roanoke
Island has survived. National Park Service archeological work
carried on under the direction of Archeologist J. C. Harrington during
the summers of 1947, 1948, and 1950 established the truth of the conjectures
of the historians. The true shape of the fort was made known.
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Enough of the fort moat, or ditch, was found intact to justify the
restoration of the fort, and valuable artifact materials were recovered at
the fort site and west of the fort entrance.</p>

</div>
<p>As the fort stands today, the greater part of the ditch is the original
moat of 1585-86, but the parapet has been restored. In the interval between
1586 and 1947, wind, rain, and snow had washed the parapet of
the fort into the fort ditch. Leaf mold had also accumulated there.
Archeological studies of these materials indicated that the fort was of
great age. After careful archeological work at the fort and its environs
in 1947 and 1948, it was decided in 1950 to restore the fort which had
been shown to be the remains of an Elizabethan work. The earthen fill
was removed from the ditch, or moat, of the fort and was placed where
the parapet had been and the parapet built up once more. Except for the
fact that the archeologists worked slowly with painstaking care to follow
the lines of the original ditch, and Lane&rsquo;s soldiers must have worked
rapidly with shovels, the new and the old process of building the parapet
of the fort must have been much the same. The amount of earth in the
original ditch, as disclosed through archeological methods, determined
the height of the parapet, which was shaped in accordance with normal
angles of repose and data from contemporary manuals on fortification
such as Paul Ive&rsquo;s, <i>The Practice of Fortification</i>, (London, 1589).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Lane&rsquo;s fort, as revealed and restored by the archeologist, is basically a
square, with pointed bastions built on two sides of the square and an
octagonal bastion built on the third side of the square. This last-mentioned
bastion is suggestive of the arrowhead bastion of Lane&rsquo;s
Puerto Rican fort as pictured by John White. It is also suggestive of the
octagonal bastion shown on the plan of St. George&rsquo;s fort built in Maine
by Popham in 1607. As the fort carries the distinctive features of Lane&rsquo;s
Puerto Rican fort, the pointed bastions built on the sides of the square
instead of at the corners as in later fortification technique (a system
either peculiar to Lane or at least quite rare), the conclusion is irresistible
that Lane was the original builder.</p>
<p>The parapet of the fort encloses an area approximately 50 feet square.
The interior had been dug into so many times and in so many places by
Indians, later settlers, soldiers of the Civil War period, and by Talcort
Williams that the National Park Service archeologist was unable to say
for sure what structures had been inside of the fort. Traces of what may
have been one long structure or two short ones were found near the
center of the fort at right angles to the main entrance. Presumably, there
were a well and a powder magazine. The few brickbats found may relate
to the footings or chimneys of the structure, or structures, in the fort or
to the magazine. The one measurable side of one of the brick fragments
found was of the proper gauge to have been of the Elizabethan period,
when the sizes of bricks were regulated by law.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Typical section through the original fort ditch and the reconstructed parapet.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The location of the fort, not far from the water&rsquo;s edge, commanding
a channel of Roanoke Sound in use for small boats even in later colonial
times, bespeaks its purpose of defending the colonists not only against
the Indians but also against an always probable attack from Spain. An
enemy ship approaching from Port Ferdinando (Hatoraske) or Trinety
Harbor, north of Hatoraske, would have come under the guns of the
fort, consisting of some brass cannon and at least &ldquo;four iron fowlers&rdquo;
(light cannon). Some of the cannon fired &ldquo;iron saker shot,&rdquo; which would
be iron balls weighing about 6 pounds. Today, large dunes lie between
the fort and the sound and obstruct the view. However, as archeological
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
tests show that the dunes are later than the period of settlement, it is
clear that the fort originally commanded a view of Roanoke Sound.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">PRESUMED LOCATION OF THE SETTLEMENT.</span></h3>
<p>As has been indicated, the
house sites of the colonists have never been found. They are described
as having been decent dwelling houses near the fort and &ldquo;about&rdquo; the
fort. They were probably built on the ground without basements or firm
footings. This would explain the difficulty of finding traces of them. The
location of the fort entrance on the west side would suggest that the
main settlement lay west of that point, toward the upper end of the
island. A more precise statement than this cannot be made at the present
time.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">THE TEMPORARY MUSEUM.</span></h3>
<p>Not far from the fort is a modern log structure
used as a temporary museum. Besides housing such objects of
historical interest as documents relating to Raleigh&rsquo;s family, pieces of
armor, and the rare facsimile reproductions in color of the remarkable
water-color drawings made in America by John White during 1585-86,
the museum contains objects which were recovered at the fort site and
elsewhere on the grounds of the national historic site during the archeological
excavations of 1947, 1948, and 1950.</p>

</div>
<p>Among the many objects brought to light is a wrought-iron sickle
found in the very bottom of the fort ditch. Undoubtedly, it was one of the
tools used at the time of the building of the fort, because archeological
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
evidence shows that the loose dirt of the parapet of the fort began to
wash back into the ditch almost as soon as the fort was completed. Even
more interesting, perhaps, are three copper, or brass, counters, popular
in Europe for keeping arithmetical accounts during the sixteenth century,
which were found inside the fort. They carry the symbols of Tudor
England and on one the name <i>Hans Schultes Zu Nuremberg</i> is readable.
Schultes is known to have manufactured such counters in Nuremberg
between 1550 and 1574, at which time Nuremberg was a center for the
making of counters. He undoubtedly made this one for the English
trade, as the Tudor symbols indicate. Likewise, of great interest are the
fragments of large Spanish olive jars found in the excavations. As the
colonists of 1585-86 traded in Puerto Rico and Haiti, in the Spanish
West Indies, for goods and supplies on their way to Roanoke Island, it
was to be expected that objects of this type would be found.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>

and traces of Indian campfires found at various soil levels show that the
Indians returned to Roanoke Island and inhabited the fort area after the
last colonists had left.</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>The National Historic Site</i></span></h2>
<p>Fort Raleigh was transferred to the National Park Service of the United
States Department of the Interior in 1940. On April 5, 1941, it was designated
Fort Raleigh National Historic Site under provision of the act
of Congress commonly referred to as the Historic Sites Act, approved
August 21, 1935 (49 Stat. 666), to commemorate Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s
colonies and the birthplace of Virginia Dare, first child of English parentage
to be born in the New World. The area of the site in Federal
ownership is 18.50 acres and embraces part of the settlement sites of
1585 and 1587 and the fort site. By a cooperative agreement between the
Roanoke Island Historical Association and the United States, the play,
the <i>Lost Colony</i>, continues to be given each season in the Waterside
Theater at Fort Raleigh. This arrangement provides for the unhampered
production of the play with all of its creative folk qualities. The income
from the play is dedicated to the maintenance of the theater, the next
season&rsquo;s production, and the expansion and development of the historic
Site.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small"><i>How to Reach the Site</i></span></h2>
<p>Fort Raleigh National Historic Site is 3 miles north of Manteo, N. C.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
